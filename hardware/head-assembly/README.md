# Magnetic Head Assembly

Multi-track GMR sensor arrays for reading 8-80 parallel data tracks.

## Overview

The magnetic head assembly is the most critical component of the HDDC system. It must precisely read 45-75μm wide tracks across the full 3.81mm tape width while maintaining ±25μm positioning accuracy.

## Technical Specifications

- **Track Count**: 8/32/50/80 (by phase)
- **Track Width**: 45-75μm per track
- **Technology**: Giant Magnetoresistive (GMR) sensors
- **Gap Length**: <1μm
- **Frequency Response**: DC to 100kHz
- **Shield-to-shield Spacing**: <100nm

## Design Variants

### Phase 1: 8-Track Array
- **Sensors**: 8x NVE AA004-02E ($15-30 each)
- **Spacing**: 0.475mm between tracks
- **PCB**: 4-layer design with magnetic shielding
- **Cost**: ~$200-300 total

### Phase 2: 32-Track Array  
- **Sensors**: 32x GMR sensors with custom PCB
- **Spacing**: 0.12mm between tracks
- **Challenges**: Inter-track crosstalk mitigation
- **Cost**: ~$500-800

### Phase 3: 50-80 Track Array
- **Sensors**: Custom fabricated sensor array
- **Spacing**: 0.05-0.076mm between tracks
- **Technology**: Potentially TMR sensors
- **Cost**: $1000-2500

- `head-mounting.step` - 3D mechanical assembly

## Manufacturing Considerations

1. **PCB Fabrication**: Requires 4-6 layer boards with via-in-pad technology
2. **Sensor Sourcing**: Limited suppliers (NVE Corporation primary)
3. **Assembly**: Manual placement with precision jigs required
4. **Testing**: Individual channel characterization needed

## Getting Started

1. Start with 8-track prototype using available sensors
2. Design custom PCB with proper shielding
3. Create alignment and test fixtures
4. Characterize frequency response and crosstalk
