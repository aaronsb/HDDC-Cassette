# Firmware Implementation

Real-time embedded software for HDDC signal processing and control.

## Overview

The firmware handles real-time signal processing across 8-80 channels, motor control, error correction, and the intelligent metadata system. This is the brain of the HDDC system.

## Architecture

### Real-Time Tasks (Priority Order)
1. **Motor Control** (1kHz) - Dual-spindle tension management
2. **ADC/DAC Streaming** (32-96 kSPS) - Multi-channel data flow
3. **Error Correction** - Reed-Solomon + LDPC processing
4. **Position Tracking** - Physics-based tape position
5. **User Interface** - Display and control response

### Platform Implementations

- **esp32/**: Development platform with WiFi/Bluetooth
- **stm32/**: High-performance professional implementation  
- **dsp/**: Platform-independent signal processing libraries

## Key Algorithms

### Signal Processing Pipeline
```
Multi-channel ADC → Digital Filtering → Clock Recovery → 
8b/10b Decoding → Block Assembly → Error Correction → 
Cross-track Recovery → Output Buffer
```

### Motor Control System
```
Current Sensing → Torque Calculation → Tension Control → 
Physics-Based Position → Adaptive Algorithms
```

## Technical Specifications

### Processing Requirements
- **Throughput**: 2.56 MSPS across 80 channels
- **Latency**: <1ms for motor control loops
- **Memory**: 512KB+ SRAM for buffering
- **Storage**: 1MB+ flash for firmware + coefficients

### Real-Time Constraints
- **ADC Interrupt**: Every 31μs (32kHz × 80 channels)
- **Motor Update**: Every 1ms for smooth control
- **Error Correction**: Adaptive timing based on quality

## Getting Started

1. **Choose Platform**: ESP32 for development, STM32 for performance
2. **Set up Toolchain**: ESP-IDF or STM32CubeIDE
3. **Start with Basic I/O**: ADC acquisition and motor PWM
4. **Add Signal Processing**: Implement clock recovery first
5. **Build Up Complexity**: Add error correction and metadata

## Key Challenges

### Real-Time Processing
- Must maintain consistent data flow across all channels
- Motor control cannot be interrupted without tape damage
- Buffer management critical for preventing data loss

### Multi-Channel Synchronization  
- All tracks must be synchronized to common clock
- Phase relationships between channels must be maintained
- Drift compensation required over long playback sessions

### Adaptive Algorithms
- Error correction effort must adapt to tape quality
- Motor control must respond to tape stretch and damage
- Metadata updates must not interrupt real-time processing
