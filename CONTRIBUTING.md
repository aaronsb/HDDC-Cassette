# Contributing to HDDC

Thank you for your interest in the High-Density Digital Cassette project!

## What This Project Is

HDDC is a thought experiment about engineering a high-density digital storage format using cassette tapes. Ideas are cheap and everyone has them - this explores "what if we could..." rather than providing definitive implementation guidance.

## How to Contribute

### Types of Contributions Welcome

1. **Technical Analysis**
   - Feasibility studies of proposed approaches
   - Alternative implementation strategies
   - Cost and complexity assessments
   - Identification of technical challenges

2. **Educational Content**
   - Explanations of complex concepts
   - Simplified implementations for learning
   - Historical context and comparisons
   - Related technology surveys

3. **Simulation and Modeling**
   - Software models of key components
   - Performance simulations
   - Visualization tools
   - Educational demonstrations

4. **Hardware Experiments**
   - Simplified prototype implementations
   - Component testing and characterization
   - Alternative approaches and comparisons
   - Documentation of lessons learned

### What We're NOT Looking For

- Claims that this is easy to implement
- Marketing or promotional content
- Unsubstantiated technical claims
- Commercial development without attribution

## Contribution Guidelines

### Technical Standards
- **Be honest about difficulty**: Don't oversimplify complex challenges
- **Cite sources**: Reference technical literature and specifications
- **Show your work**: Include calculations, simulations, or test data
- **Consider alternatives**: Compare different approaches objectively

### Documentation Standards
- **Clear explanations**: Assume intelligent but non-expert readers
- **Practical focus**: What would actually be required to build this?
- **Educational value**: Help others learn from your work
- **Reality checks**: Honest assessment of feasibility and cost

### Code Contributions
- **Well commented**: Explain the theory behind implementations
- **Modular design**: Make components reusable and testable
- **Include tests**: Demonstrate that code works as intended
- **Document limitations**: What doesn't work and why

## Attribution Requirements

This project uses CC BY-SA 4.0 licensing with additional attribution requirements:

1. **Credit Aaron Bockelie** as the original concept creator
2. **Link to this repository** in any derivative work
3. **Indicate changes** you've made to the original design
4. **Maintain open licensing** for derivative works

## Getting Started

1. **Read the technical specification** to understand the full concept
2. **Choose an area of interest** from the repository structure
3. **Start small** - even simple contributions are valuable
4. **Ask questions** via GitHub issues if you need clarification
5. **Share your work** through pull requests

## Review Process

Contributions will be reviewed for:
- Technical accuracy and honesty
- Educational value
- Appropriate scope and complexity
- Adherence to attribution requirements
- Code quality (for software contributions)

## Community Standards

- **Be respectful** of different skill levels and perspectives
- **Focus on learning** rather than commercial outcomes
- **Acknowledge uncertainty** when making technical claims
- **Share knowledge** generously with proper attribution
- **Have fun** exploring these engineering concepts!

## Questions?

Open a GitHub issue for:
- Technical questions about the specification
- Clarification on contribution guidelines
- Suggestions for new areas of exploration
- Discussion of alternative approaches

Remember: This is about exploring "what if we could..." rather than building a commercial product. The goal is education, inspiration, and technical exploration.
