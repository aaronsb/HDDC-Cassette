# Documentation

Assembly guides, calibration procedures, and educational materials.

## Overview

This directory contains comprehensive documentation for building, calibrating, and understanding HDDC systems.

## Directory Structure

- **assembly/**: Step-by-step build instructions for each phase
- **calibration/**: Precision alignment and optimization procedures

## Documentation Philosophy

Since HDDC is a thought experiment, the documentation serves dual purposes:
1. **Educational**: Help people understand the engineering concepts
2. **Practical**: Provide guidance if someone attempts implementation

## Key Documents

### Assembly Guides
- Phase 1: 8-track prototype construction
- Phase 2: 32-track system assembly  
- Phase 3: Advanced 50-80 track implementation
- PCB motor fabrication and assembly
- Precision alignment procedures

### Calibration Procedures
- Azimuth alignment (±2 arc minutes)
- Head height adjustment (±50μm)
- Track gain calibration
- Motor control optimization
- Metadata system initialization

### Educational Materials
- Multi-track magnetic recording principles
- Error correction theory and implementation
- PCB motor design fundamentals
- Real-time signal processing concepts

## Target Audience

### Makers and Hobbyists
- Understand what would be required to build this
- Learn about advanced engineering concepts
- Explore possibilities for simplified implementations

### Engineering Students
- Study complex systems integration
- Learn about magnetic recording technology
- Understand real-time embedded systems

### Researchers
- Evaluate feasibility of various approaches
- Identify critical technical challenges
- Develop alternative solutions

## Quality Standards

All documentation includes:
- **Precision Requirements**: Exact tolerances and specifications
- **Safety Warnings**: Potential hazards and precautions
- **Alternative Approaches**: Multiple ways to achieve goals
- **Reality Checks**: Honest assessment of difficulty and cost

## Getting Started

1. **Read the main technical specification** for complete overview
2. **Start with Phase 1 assembly guide** for practical introduction
3. **Review calibration procedures** to understand precision requirements
4. **Explore educational materials** for deeper technical understanding

*Note: This documentation treats HDDC as a serious engineering challenge while acknowledging it's a thought experiment. The goal is education and inspiration rather than definitive implementation guidance.*
