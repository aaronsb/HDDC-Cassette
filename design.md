# HDDC Project Design Document

## Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

### ADR-001: Repository Structure Organization ✅ Locked
**Decision**: Organize repository using the structure defined in technical specification section 11.1
**Context**: Need clear separation between hardware, firmware, software, and documentation components
**Rationale**: 
- Mirrors the natural divisions in the technical specification
- Allows specialists to focus on their domain without cross-contamination
- Enables parallel development across different skill sets
- Facilitates modular testing and validation
**Consequences**: 
- Contributors can work independently on different subsystems
- Clear boundaries reduce merge conflicts
- Documentation is co-located with relevant implementations

### ADR-002: Educational Focus Over Production Implementation ✅ Locked
**Decision**: Prioritize educational value and conceptual understanding over production-ready code
**Context**: This is a thought experiment project meant to explore complex technical concepts
**Rationale**:
- Complex concepts like GMR sensor arrays, multi-track recording, and error correction need explanation
- Real implementation would require expensive components (GMR sensors $750-2400)
- Focus on teaching principles rather than building commercial products
- Stub files should explain "what would need to be built" rather than providing complete solutions
**Consequences**:
- README files contain extensive technical explanations
- Code stubs include comprehensive comments about implementation challenges
- Documentation explains trade-offs and alternatives
- Cost considerations are prominently featured

### ADR-003: Multi-Platform Firmware Approach ✅ Locked
**Decision**: Provide firmware implementations for ESP32, STM32, and generic DSP libraries
**Context**: Different platforms offer different capabilities and cost points
**Rationale**:
- ESP32: WiFi/Bluetooth capability, moderate performance, low cost
- STM32: High performance DSP, professional applications, higher cost
- Generic DSP: Algorithm documentation independent of hardware platform
**Consequences**:
- Broader appeal to different maker communities
- Clear performance trade-offs documented
- Algorithms can be adapted to other platforms

### ADR-004: Layered Complexity Presentation ✅ Locked
**Decision**: Present concepts in layers from simple to complex
**Context**: Technical specification covers everything from basic concepts to advanced implementations
**Rationale**:
- Start with 8-track prototype concepts (simpler, cheaper)
- Progress to 32-track intermediate implementation
- Full 50-80 track implementation as advanced concept
- PCB motor design as revolutionary enhancement
**Consequences**:
- Accessible entry point for beginners
- Clear progression path for learning
- Advanced concepts don't overwhelm newcomers
- Implementation phases naturally emerge

### ADR-005: Technical Specification Cross-Referencing ✅ Locked
**Decision**: Every stub file and README must reference specific sections of the technical specification
**Context**: 1200+ line technical specification contains detailed information
**Ratability**: 
- Maintains traceability between concepts and implementations
- Helps contributors understand the bigger picture
- Ensures implementation stubs address real technical challenges
- Facilitates finding relevant information quickly
**Consequences**:
- Every file includes section references like "See tech spec 4.2.1"
- Concepts are grounded in technical reality
- Contributors can dive deeper into specific areas
